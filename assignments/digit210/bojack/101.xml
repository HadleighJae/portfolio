</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:51"><subtitle>
Welcome, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:52"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:53"><subtitle>
Sorry I was late.The traffic--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
It's really no problem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:56"><subtitle>
I parkedin a handicapped spot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:57"><subtitle>
I hope that's okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:59"><subtitle>
You parked in a--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:00"><subtitle>
I'm sorry, disabled spot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:01"><subtitle>
Is that the proper nomenclature?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:03"><subtitle>
Maybe you shouldmove the car.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:05"><subtitle>
No, I don't thinkI should drive right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:06"><subtitle>
I'm incredibly drunk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:08"><subtitle>
You're telling methat you're drunk right now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:11"><subtitle>
Is it just me,or am I nailing this interview?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:13"><subtitle>
I kind of feel likeI'm nailing it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:14"><subtitle>
Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:16"><subtitle>
Anyway, we were talkingabout Horsin' Around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:19"><subtitle>
To what do you attributethe show's wide appeal?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:21"><subtitle>
Charlie, listen, you know,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:23"><subtitle>
I know that it's very hipthese daysto shitall over Horsin' Around,but at the time,I can tell you--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:27"><subtitle>
- Is it okay to say "shit"?- Please don't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:28"><subtitle>
'Cause I-- I think the show'sactually pretty solidfor what it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:31"><subtitle>
It's not Ibsen, sure,but look,for a lot of people,life is just one long,hard kick in the urethra,and sometimeswhen you get homefrom a long day ofgetting kicked in the urethra,you just want to watch a showabout good, likable peoplewho love each other,where, you know,no matter what happens,at the end of 30 minutes,everything'sgonna turn out okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:50"><subtitle>
You know,because in real life--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:52"><subtitle>
Did I already say the thingabout the urethra?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:55"><subtitle>
Well, let's talkabout real life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:56"><subtitle>
What have you been doingsince the show's cancellation</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:00"><subtitle>
That's a great question,Charlie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
a troubled gay teenor something.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
that you meant you were lazy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
