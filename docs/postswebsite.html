                    <p>For my analysis assignment, I compare and contrast three of Ray Bradbury's short stories with 3 of his novels. Of his short stories, I chose A Sound of Thunder, The Veldt, and There Will Come Soft Rains. For his novels, I chose Fahrenheit 451, Death is a Lonely Business, and The Martian Chronicles. The reason I chose these is that I wanted to see if there was a strong similarity or difference between Ray Bradbury's writing styles in his novels versus his short stories.</p>

<p>For his novels, I saw that the term "there was a" had been used many times throughout the three novels, as he uses it 98 times throughout the three. This is .05% of the text's n-grams of 3. OFtentimes, "long," "smell," "man," "sound," and "small" are used after this term.

<p>Another term used often is "the old man," used 84 times in the three novels, typically after a quote from a character. Similar to the last term, it also occurs .05% of the time.

<p>The long term "in the middle of the" is used 26 times throughout these three novels. In other words, this term is used .016% of the time.

<p>The short stories had very similar writing styles. Like the novels, a very common term was "there was a" which occurs .05% of the time. This term had also been followed by the word "sound."

<p>A term not used as much in the novels include "the smell of"
