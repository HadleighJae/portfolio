  <h1>About</h1>
    <p><img src="images/queen.JPG" alt="me" style="float:left; padding: 10px">Hi! My name is Hadleigh Jae Bills and I am currently a Freshman at Penn State Behrend.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was young, I've always had a big imagination. Whether it be drawing, performing, or writing, I would always try to create something using these creative outlets. I think of my life as one big art project, and I want it to be a masterpiece.</p>
    <p>During my short 18 years on this planet, I have performed in 33 shows, directed one show, wrote a few short stories, and so much more! At the moment, however, my main focus is on getting through my first semester of college and making that experience the best it can be!</p>
    <p>If you would like to know more, you can check out my resume to see what I have done.</p>
