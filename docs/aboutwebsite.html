                    <h5>Last Updated Oct. 7, 2022</h5>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Hadleigh Jae Bills. I am 18-years-old, and I am currently a
                        Freshman at Penn State Behrend.</p>
                    <p>Ever since I was young, I've always had a big imagination. Whether it be
                        drawing, performing, or writing, I would always try to create something
                        using these creative outlets. I think of my life as one big art project, and
                        I want it to be a masterpiece.</p>
                    <p>During my short 18 years on this planet, I have performed in 33 shows,
                        directed one show, wrote a few short stories, and so much more! At the
                        moment, however, my main focus is on getting through my first semester of
                        college and making that experience the best it can be!</p>
